## Introduction

This repository contains various C# projects developed as part of the 3D Game Server course at Keimyung University. Each project demonstrates different aspects of game server development, including multithreading, networking, and security.

## Projects

### TicTacToe

A simple console-based TicTacToe game. The game allows two players to play against each other on the same machine.

### Multithreaded Space Shooter Game

A multithreaded space shooter game where the player can move and shoot enemies. The game demonstrates the use of multithreading to handle enemy movements and player actions concurrently.

### UDP Chat Program

A multi-client chat program using UDP. The project includes both client and server implementations, allowing multiple clients to communicate with each other through a central server.

### BattleNet

A networked game server project that allows multiple clients to connect and interact in a shared environment. The project demonstrates the use of TCP for reliable communication between clients and the server.

### FartRoom

A multiplayer game where players can move around a room, pick up items, and attack each other. The game uses TCP for communication and includes both client and server implementations.

### Treasure Hunter

A networked treasure hunting game where players can move around a map, search for treasures, and interact with other players. The project includes both client and server implementations and demonstrates the use of TCP for real-time communication.

### Secure Server

A project focused on implementing security features in a game server. The project includes both client and server implementations and demonstrates the use of encryption and secure communication protocols.
